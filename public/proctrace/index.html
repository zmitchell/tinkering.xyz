  <p><code>proctrace</code> is a profiler that runs on top of <a href="https://github.com/bpftrace/bpftrace">bpftrace</a> (for now) and traces
the execution of a process tree rooted at a user-provided command.
Right now it records the following events and the time between them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fork</code></li>
<li><code>exec</code></li>
<li><code>exit</code></li>
<li><code>setsid</code></li>
<li><code>setpgid</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In the future I'd like to extend that to opening/closing/inheriting file
descriptors and reads/writes.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/zmitchell/proctrace">repository on GitHub</a> and usage instructions
on the <a href="https://proctrace.xyz">documentation site</a>.</p>

    <summary>RustConf 2024</summary>
    <p>I'll be at RustConf 2024 in Montreal in just a few days.
If you'd like to get together and chat about <code>proctrace</code> or <a href="https://flox.dev">Flox</a>,

<p>The output can be rendered in a few different ways,
but the most interesting one is as a Mermaid Gantt diagram
(inspired by <a href="https://brycemecum.com/2023/03/31/til-mermaid-tracing/">this article</a>).
If you were to clone the <a href="https://github.com/zmitchell/proctrace">proctrace repo</a> on Linux and do the following:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>$ flox activate # provides dev dependencies
</span><span>$ cargo build

</span></code></pre>
<p>then copy the output of the final command into the <a href="https://mermaid.live">Mermaid Live Editor</a>,
you would see something like this:

<p>You can probably already spot some of the known bugs in <code>proctrace</code> from looking
at that image,
but we'll get into that later.
First, let's discuss why I wrote <code>proctrace</code> and what problems it's intended to solve (for me at least).</p>

<p>I work at <a href="https://flox.dev">Flox</a>,
which is a new tool for setting up reproducible developer environments using
carefully configured subshells and Nix under the hood.
The idea is that you get the best of both worlds:
everything "just works" from machine to machine and developer to developer,
but you also don't have to mount in your home directory just to keep your
dotfiles like you would inside of a container.
I actually used Flox to develop <code>proctrace</code>,
and if you're interested in reading about what that looks like,
you can read about that <a href="https://flox.dev/blog/rust">here</a>.
That's the end of the product pitch, I promise.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://github.com/flox/flox/releases/tag/v1.3.0">recently released</a> a feature called
<a href="https://flox.dev/docs/concepts/services/">"service management"</a>,
which is our take on providing long-running programs (e.g. a web server, database, etc)
to your development environment like you would with Docker Compose or
<code>overmind</code>/<code>hivemind</code>.
The difference is that we automatically clean up those processes when you leave
your development environment (e.g. close your shell).</p>
<p>Getting all of that working was a bit of a hassle due to the wealth of race
conditions involved,
the various ways in which an error could cause processes to be leaked, etc.
The race conditions caused <em>several</em> flaky tests that would regularly cause
issues for the entire test suite.</p>
<p>For example, since we do a lot of gymnastics to configure your shell properly
we want to ensure that we have good test coverage for that.
We make extensive use of <a href="https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core">bats</a>,
the Bash Automated Test Suite,
for writing certain tests as shell scripts since trying to test how a shell behaves
turns out to be a bit of a nightmare from something other than a shell.</p>
<hr />
<details>
    <summary>matklad had helpful ideas</summary>
    <p>I'm a bit of a testing nerd and the state of our test suite really bugs me.
I've been reading <a href="https://matklad.github.io/">Alex Kladov's blog</a> for a while,
and one of the things they write about extensively is testing.
At one point I reached out for advice and they were very helpful with their
suggestions,
but we haven't found the time to actually implement them :)
That's startup life for you.</p>

</details>
<hr />
<p>Since <code>bats</code> is aimed at things happening in your shell,
it captures <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> so that you can make assertions about their
contents.
This means that if you want to debug by printing/<code>echo</code>ing,
that output would get mixed in with the output of the program under test.
<code>bats</code> gets around this by opening a new file descriptor (3).
When you write to fd 3,
the output is shown without being captured.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it also waits for this file descriptor to
be closed before the test suite will conclude.
If a process inherits this file descriptor and is later backgrounded,
you have a perfect storm for a deadlock.
<code>bats</code> will happily wait forever for that file descriptor to close
while the background process happily waits for someone to clean it up.
This is a <a href="https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writing-tests.html#file-descriptor-3-read-this-if-bats-hangs">known issue</a>
that <code>bats</code> warns you about (if you read the documentation),
but sometimes you make mistakes.</p>
<p>This issue rocked our world for a little bit when we were getting service
management off the ground.
We didn't have great visibility into which tests were even causing the failures
(the tests all passed),
much less which processes were holding on to fd 3.</p>
<p>I wanted to be able to quickly and easily identify which test leaked the
background process,
what the background process <em>was</em>,
etc.
There weren't really any tools I found that would let me do this out of the box,
so I wrote <code>proctrace</code>.</p>

<p>Given a PID, I need to be able to track:</p>

<li>When it creates a new process via <code>fork</code></li>
<li>When it executes a new program via <code>exec</code></li>

<p>I saw two interfaces to choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li>User turns on recording and events are recorded from all processes, user runs their command, user stops recording, user tells <code>proctrace</code> to post-process and return the clean output.</li>
<li>User supplies a command, we run it for them and filter irrelevant events, then give them the clean output.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both have their tradeoffs.</p>
<p>The "record everything" approach puts control flow in the user's hands,
leaves them with a recording that contains more information than is necessary,
and requires that they know how to do the post-processing that they need
e.g. which PID is the root of the process tree.
It also lets the user do multiple rounds of post-processing without the need to
collect another recording.</p>
<p>The "do it for the user" approach requires less of the user,
but doesn't allow for different types of post-processing without another recording.</p>
<p>As you'll see later,
we're actually able to meet both of these needs,
but I decided the default mode would be the "do it for the user" mode.</p>

<p>I knew that I had a few tools at my disposal for collecting the kinds of events
that I was looking for,
namely <code>strace</code>, <code>DTrace</code>, and <code>bpftrace</code>
(you know, all of the <code>*trace</code>s).
<code>DTrace</code> and <code>bpftrace</code> have the advantage that they're scriptable and use
similar scripting languages,
so I immediately gravitated towards those tools.</p>
<p>One benefit of starting the command for the user is that you get to know which
PID is at the root of the process tree while you're recording.
The downside is that you're also responsible for starting recording before that
command runs (so you don't miss the beginning of its execution),
so you have to start the recorder before you know the PID.
At that point it's also too late to somehow embed the PID
in the execution of the tool (e.g. through templating a script or something).
You could do something like issue a sentinel system call containing the
PID,
but that would be cursed.</p>
<p>Given that constraint,
the recorder will know nothing about which PIDs it's interested in and just
report events for all PIDs.
An external tool (<code>proctrace</code>) will consume those events and do the book keeping.</p>
<p>For now <code>proctrace</code> only supports <code>bpftrace</code> because there is a <a href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/735939">macOS bug</a>
that causes your machine to hang if you run DTrace and your machine has ever
been to sleep since boot.
Putting your machine to sleep seems like an edge case to me though,
so I get it.</p>

<p>When do we stop recording?
To me the most reasonable answer is "when all of the processes in the tree have exited."
In the case that a process doesn't exit,
the user will need to <code>Ctrl-C</code> and kill the recording,
at which point <code>proctrace</code> should persist any data that was still in flight
and exit.
If <code>proctrace</code> detects that all of the processes in the tree have exited,
it will shutdown automatically.</p>
<p>Right now <code>proctrace</code> doesn't kill the process that was still running,
but there's an open issue to do this in the future.</p>

<p>Before we get into implementation challenges, let's talk about how you use
<code>proctrace</code>.</p>
<p>First you create a recording:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>$ proctrace record -o &lt;file&gt; -- &lt;cmd&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>This will call <code>bpftrace</code> under the hood, so it will prompt for your password.
If you've installed <code>bpftrace</code> in a location that's only in your user's
<code>PATH</code>
(this is the case if you've installed via Flox or <code>nix profile install</code>),
then you'll need to pass in the path of the <code>bpftrace</code> execuable with the
<code>-b</code> flag.</p>
<p>This command will record events in newline-delimited JSON format to the
specified file.
It looks like this:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>{&quot;Fork&quot;:{&quot;timestamp&quot;:874106944,&quot;parent_pid&quot;:566940,&quot;child_pid&quot;:566954,&quot;parent_pgid&quot;:566939}}
</span><span>{&quot;Exec&quot;:{&quot;timestamp&quot;:874201623,&quot;pid&quot;:566954,&quot;ppid&quot;:566940,&quot;pgid&quot;:566954,&quot;cmdline&quot;:null}}
</span><span>{&quot;ExecArgs&quot;:{&quot;timestamp&quot;:874201623,&quot;pid&quot;:566954,&quot;args&quot;:&quot;/usr/bin/env bash ./demo_script.sh&quot;}}
</span><span>{&quot;ExecArgs&quot;:{&quot;timestamp&quot;:874201623,&quot;pid&quot;:566954,&quot;args&quot;:&quot;./demo_script.sh&quot;}}
</span><span>...
</span></code></pre>
<p>Once you have that recording you can render it in a few ways.
I've already showed you the Mermaid output above, so I'll skip that.</p>
<p>The default render method (<code>sequential</code>) is to just display the events in the order that they
occurred.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>{&quot;Fork&quot;:{&quot;timestamp&quot;:874106944,&quot;parent_pid&quot;:566940,&quot;child_pid&quot;:566954,&quot;parent_pgid&quot;:566939}}
</span><span>{&quot;Exec&quot;:{&quot;timestamp&quot;:874201623,&quot;pid&quot;:566954,&quot;ppid&quot;:566940,&quot;pgid&quot;:566954,&quot;cmdline&quot;:&quot;/usr/bin/env bash ./demo_script.sh&quot;}}
</span><span>{&quot;Exec&quot;:{&quot;timestamp&quot;:875457447,&quot;pid&quot;:566954,&quot;ppid&quot;:566940,&quot;pgid&quot;:566954,&quot;cmdline&quot;:&quot;bash ./demo_script.sh&quot;}}
</span><span>...
</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice that the <code>ExecArgs</code> events have been removed.
That's part of the post-processing that's done when rendering, but we'll get
into that later.</p>
<p>The other render method (<code>by-process</code>) does a similar thing except it groups
events by process and reports processes in the order that they were forked.</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that we're able to meet both sets of needs:
"do it for me" and "put me in the driver's seat".
That's accomplished by taking "raw" recordings.</p>
<p>A raw recording is simply the recorded output of the <code>bpftrace</code> script.
You can do this one of two ways.
Since the script is stored in the repository and we quite literally just
write its output,
you could just run the script yourself whenever and however you want.</p>
<p>That output looks like this:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>EXEC: ts=874201623,pid=566954,ppid=566940,pgid=566954

</span><span>EXEC_ARGS: ts=875354678,pid=566954,bash ./demo_script.sh
</span><span>...
</span></code></pre>
<p>The other way is to run <code>proctrace record</code> with the <code>--raw</code> flag,
in which case it will also tell you the PID of your command,
which you'll need for the next step:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>$ proctrace record -r -o demo_raw.log -- ./demo_script.sh
</span><span>...
</span><span>Process tree root was PID 305101
</span></code></pre>
<p>One of the benefits of a raw recording is that you can ingest and render a
process tree from a root other than the command that you actually ran.
For instance, say I recorded the entire shell test suite for Flox,
then only wanted to render the process tree starting at a particular test.
I would need to track down that PID, but that's not terribly difficult.</p>
<p>To turn the raw recording into something renderable,
you use the <code>proctrace ingest</code> command:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>$ proctrace ingest -i demo_raw.log -o demo_ingested.log --root-pid 12345
</span></code></pre>

<p>In order to start recording we launch <code>bpftrace</code> with a <a href="https://github.com/zmitchell/proctrace/blob/main/proctrace/assets/proctrace.bt">script</a>
that's stored in the repository.
This script enables probes for certain events in the Linux kernel and then
prints formatted output that <code>proctrace</code> can parse.
An example of one of these probes is shown below:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>tracepoint:sched:sched_process_exit
</span><span>{
</span><span>  $task = (struct task_struct *)curtask;
</span><span>  // Ensures that we don&#39;t record threads exiting
</span><span>  if ($task-&gt;pid == $task-&gt;tgid) {
</span><span>    $ts = elapsed;
</span><span>  	printf(&quot;EXIT: ts=%u,pid=%d,ppid=%d,pgid=%d\n&quot;, $ts, $task-&gt;tgid, $task-&gt;real_parent-&gt;tgid, $task-&gt;group_leader-&gt;tgid);
</span><span>  }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>If you aren't familiar with the inner workings of the Linux kernel,
playing around with <code>bpftrace</code> is actually a great way to learn.
For example,
you may not have known that threads and processes are actually represented with
the same data structure (<code>struct task_struct</code>).</p>
<p>This means that if you're only interested in process-level events,
then you need to ensure that your probes filter out events from threads.
Confusingly, each task has a <code>pid</code> field which is not actually the user-space
PID,
but I guess more of a generic ID for the task.
A user-space process is referred to as a "thread group".
If you want to record an event once per process you can check whether the
task that triggered the probe is the main thread of the process.
That's what the <code>$task-&gt;pid == $task-&gt;tgid</code> check is doing in the probe above.</p>

<p>Early on when I was testing <code>proctrace</code> on Flox I would often see a flurry
of <code>fork</code>s when Flox started.
I knew it wasn't <em>actually</em> forking,
and after some investigation I determined that it was this
"thread vs. process" distinction that was missing.</p>
<p>It turns out that on Linux both creating new threads and creating new processes
go through the <code>clone</code> system call,
and silly me I guess I expected the <code>tracepoint:sched:sched_process_fork</code> probe
to only fire when processes fork given that...it's what the name says.
So instead of using that probe I switched to instrumenting <code>clone</code> directly and
inspecting the flags passed to <code>clone</code> that determine whether a thread or a process
gets created.</p>
<p>This is also an interesting system call to instrument because it returns more
than once!
It returns once in the parent (the caller), and once in the child
(the new thread or process).
In order to only capture one of these I actually have <em>two</em> probes for <code>clone</code>,
one that fires upon entry, and one that fires on exit.</p>

<p>On every <code>sys_enter_clone</code> we check whether we're about to create a thread,
skip it if we are,
then record both the thread ID and the timestamp.
We record the thread ID since multiple threads within a process could be calling
<code>fork</code>.</p>
<p>Then, on <code>sys_exit_clone</code> I check whether the task returning from the system
call has been recorded.
If it has, that means it's the thread that called <code>fork</code> in the parent process.
If it hasn't, that means it's a thread in the child process.
I record the result from the parent process because the return value tells us
the PID of the newly created child process.</p>
<p>I record the timestamp because I noticed that the <code>fork</code> and <code>exec</code> were appearing
out of order.
I don't actually know why this was happening,
but recording the <code>enter</code> timestamp allows us to put things back in the correct order
during post-processing.</p>

<p>When <code>proctrace</code> is ingesting events from <code>bpftrace</code> it stores events in two
different event stores:
one for "tracked" events and one for "buffered" events.
The stores are identical in terms of their functionality,
they're each just a <code>BTreeMap&lt;i32, VecDeque&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</code> in Rust parlance.</p>
<p>While ingesting events if we see a <code>fork</code> whose parent PID is one we're already
tracking then we add the child PID to the "tracked" store.
From that point forward any events from that PID will be added to the tracked
store.</p>
<p>The buffered store is a response to this "fork and exec can appear out of order"
problem.
Say PID 1 forks into PID 2.
If an <code>exec</code> from PID 2 appears before we've seen the <code>fork</code>,
we will not yet have added PID 2 to the tracked event store,
and we'll discard this <code>exec</code> event.
Instead, we buffer this <code>exec</code> and when we see the <code>fork</code> we unbuffer all events
from the process.
We also iterate over the buffered store to ensure that any other events from
descendants of PID 2 would be unbuffered as well.
In practice I don't think the <code>fork</code> ever appears quite that late,
but it seemed like a good idea to be safe anyway.</p>
<p>Right now that buffer never gets emptied, so it just grows over time,
but there's an open issue to do garbage collection.</p>

<p>There are multiple issues here.
First is that there appears to be a <a href="https://github.com/bpftrace/bpftrace/issues/3384">bug</a> that causes <code>bpftrace</code>
to just fail to print the arguments.
I'm not sure what the actual limitation is,
but <code>bpftrace</code> doesn't seem to be able to join an array of strings and return
that as a new string to be used in a format string.
The <code>join()</code> function simply takes an array of strings and prints it with a
newline at the end,
so I actually have to print a single <code>exec</code> event as two different lines:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_execve
</span><span>{
</span><span>  $task = (struct task_struct *)curtask;
</span><span>  $ts = elapsed;
</span><span>  printf(&quot;EXEC: ts=%u,pid=%d,ppid=%d,pgid=%d\n&quot;, $ts, $task-&gt;tgid, $task-&gt;real_parent-&gt;tgid, $task-&gt;group_leader-&gt;tgid);
</span><span>  printf(&quot;EXEC_ARGS: ts=%u,pid=%d,&quot;, $ts, $task-&gt;tgid);
</span><span>  join(args.argv);
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Even then that second event (<code>EXEC_ARGS</code>) just might not have any arguments
for me.
To mitigate this I also query <code>/proc</code> at runtime for each <code>exec</code> tracked in
a recording.</p>
<p>Again, there's multiple issues here.
The process may have done another <code>exec</code> before I query <code>/proc</code> and I may get
the wrong set of arguments.
The process may have exited before I query <code>/proc</code> and it may not have anything
for me.
I may get different arguments compared to what <code>bpftrace</code> reports,
and now I have to choose which arguments to show.</p>
<p>I haven't had time to look into why the arguments would be different,
so at the moment I'm just using the longer (by joined string length) of the two
sets of arguments under the assumption that the longer set has more information.
I went that direction because I noticed that in most cases the arguments were
the same or otherwise a subset of one another (or something like that).</p>

<p>Finally,
the bug I mentioned at the very beginning of the article.</p>
<p><img src="/images/demo-process-trace.webp" alt="A Gantt chart showing the execution of a Bash script" /></p>
<p>Sometimes I just get duplicate <code>exec</code>s and I have no idea why.
I suspect there's an issue with the <code>bpftrace</code> script such that it's not filtering out
threads again e.g. <code>sys_enter_execve</code> is actually shorthand for
<code>sys_enter_execve_just_kidding_this_also_fires_on_threads_too</code>.</p>
<p>If you look closely, there are two <code>&lt;fork&gt;</code> events,
one before the <code>sleep</code> and one after the <code>curl</code>.
I think those are actually <code>printf</code> calls,
which I suppose means that we're entirely missing the <code>exec</code> calls for those
two events.
I've noticed this kind of behavior around things that are shell builtins,
but in that hastily thrown together demo script I specifically call
<code>command -v printf</code> to avoid running the builtin.</p>

<p>If you have a command that contains a colon character,
Mermaid just won't render the diagram.
I've run into this with scripts that use <code>getopt</code>.
All it takes to get it working again is to manually go delete those colons
and Mermaid will be happy again.</p>
<p>Mermaid also doesn't seem to let you use arbitrary timescales,
so we're stuck using milliseconds at the moment.
For that reason I round up the execution time of each span
(e.g. time between a <code>fork</code> and <code>exit</code>, between two successive <code>exec</code>s, etc)
to 1ms if it would otherwise be less than that.
Mermaid also seems to really enjoy stretching diagrams out horizontally
more than is necessary.
Oh well, it clearly wasn't designed for what I'm using it for.</p>

<p>It's early days for <code>proctrace</code> and there's a lot of low-hanging fruit if you'd
like to pitch in.
Check out the <a href="https://github.com/zmitchell/proctrace/issues">Github Issues page</a> and see what interests you.</p>
<p>Ultimately I'd like to generate HTML reports similar to how Cargo generates
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/timings.html">build timings reports</a>.
That would allow us to more accurately and more flexibly display the information
that we already have,
but would also allow us to display other information as well.
For example, we already have information about process groups,
so you could color each span according to the process group that it belongs to.</p>
<p>If you have thoughts about how to make <code>proctrace</code> more correct or more
ergonomic,
I'd love to hear them.</p>
