description = "In the previous post I described how to build a flake from scratch. The intention was that since I want this series to focus on flakes learning how to write a flake was a natural starting point. While writing it I realized that there's just so much of the Nix world out there that isn't based on flakes, so in order to not hit a wall we'll have to understand what a pre-flake Nix packaging workflow looks like. This post will explain how to read and understand an \"old\" Nix package."
