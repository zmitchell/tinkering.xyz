I _**love**_ the details. I'm the kind of person that watches YouTube videos about Unix syscalls in his free time ü§ì.

I'm finishing up the last year of my physics PhD at Purdue University, where I study the details of photosynthesis using ‚ö°Ô∏èultrafast spectroscopy‚ö°Ô∏è. Have you burned holes in your business cards with 100 femotosecond laser pulses? I have! I also write the software that glues together the equipment used in my experiments.

I've been writing Python for a little over 5 years. I decided to try Rust for a side project and it was love at first sight ‚ù§Ô∏è. I've been tinkering away at things in Rust ever since. From there I developed an interest in systems programming.

This blog is made using [Gutenberg](getgutenberg.io), a static site generator written in Rust ("Rewrite It In Rust" can apply to blogs too). The site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), a service I can't believe is free.
