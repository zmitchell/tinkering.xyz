Hi, I'm Zach. I *love* learning how things works and using that knowledge to build new things. When I'm not reading about software you can find me on a disc golf course, rolling dice with a Dungeons & Dragons group, or playing around with generative art.

I'm currently building developer tools at [flox](flox.dev) with Rust and Nix.
I'm also one of the organizers for the Boulder Rust Meetup.

I recently completed a physics PhD at Purdue University where I studied the details of photosynthesis using ultrafast spectroscopy. I built state of the art time resolved laser systems and did computational modeling of quantum-biological systems both on small computers (laptops) and big computers (supercomputing clusters). I also wrote all of the software currently running in the lab ranging from data acquisition and hardware control to numerical analysis.
