Hi, I'm Zach. I *love* building things and learning how things work. I also love disc golf and Dungeons & Dragons, but that's not what this blog is about.

I'm finishing up my physics PhD at Purdue University, where I study the details of photosynthesis using ultrafast spectroscopy. Have you burned holes in your business cards with 100 femotosecond laser pulses? I have! I write the software that orchestrates the hardware in our experiments, and the software that analyzes our data. If something in our lab is automated, I did that, just don't ask how long it took.

## My story
My first interaction with programming was a numerical techniques class using Matlab that was required for my physics degree. I didn't do much programming after that until I spent a summer on a research project that required more analysis than was comfortable to do in Excel. I wrote this analysis program in Matlab since that was what I knew. I only discovered afterwards that no one else in that lab had a Matlab license.

I never wanted that to happen again, so I picked up Python. Once I had a full programming language at my disposal I felt the need to make use of it. I started writing more and more programs, and started reading more and more about best practices.

That was almost 10 years ago.

At some point I picked up Rust, and through Rust I developed an interest in systems programming. I became very interested in correctness, and Rust's compiler is nothing if not interested in correctness.

A few years later I stumbled upon generative art, and decided to learn Clojure as a means of trying my hand at it. As I learned about Clojure I realized that ~~fear~~ complexity is the mind-killer, and became more interestd in Clojure as a general purpose language. I'm still a baby when it comes to Clojure, but I'm eager to find excuses to use it.
