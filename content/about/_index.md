### Me
I'm a physics graduate student at Purdue University, where I study the very first steps of photosynthesis using time-resolved spectroscopy. The lasers we use in our lab spit out intense pulses of light with durations as short as 25fs (25e-15 s), which is bananas. I also write the software that glues all the pieces of equipment together when necessary.

I love to teach people, automate things to make their lives easier, and build tools for them. There's nothing quite like building something for someone and seeing them appreciate your work and the design decisions you made for them. To that end I had been writing things in Python for a while. I decided to try Rust for a side project in December of 2017, and it was love at first sight ❤️. I've been tinkering away at things in Rust ever since.

### The Blog
This blog is made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator written in Go. The site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) rather than S3 or GitHub Pages because the setup process is easier than GitHub Pages, the refresh rate is faster than GitHub Pages, and, more importantly, Netlify saves me $0.51/month over S3.
